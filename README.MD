# GORSO

GORSO is a Riot OAuth API wrapper written in pure Go.

### Prerequisites

For the moment, OAuth API does not provide any official documentation. All endpoints and parameters provided in GORSO are based on the [Henrik-3 gist](https://gist.github.com/Henrik-3/d6b631fb7c61821bc16b17cd347a3811).

This package does not attempt to implement Riot API in its entirety, covering only the newest public RSO feature. To access remaining methods, we recommend checking out packages such as [golio](https://github.com/KnutZuidema/golio)

### Usage
